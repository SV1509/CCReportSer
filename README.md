Mahindra Born Electric Range of Electric Vehicles represents a paradigm shift for Mahindra & Mahindra. The shift to connected cars and electric vehicles (EVs) brings new challenges and opportunities. Data analytics capabilities become a core business capability for Mahindra, offering competitive advantages.
Competitive Advantages when Analytics becomes a Core Business Capability
Above factors make the Data Analytics Capabilities as a core business capability for Mahindra. While the paradigm shifts bring in new challenges, it also opens up new opportunities when the information is harnessed with deep Analytical rigor. Mahindra can gain the following competitive advantages from BEVs.
 Proposed Solution
Overview
 
This solution aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of connected cars by implementing one integrated Analytics Solution that covers key areas like;
1.	Exploratory Data Analytics
2.	Pattern Recognition
3.	Anomaly Detection 
4.	Failure Prediction & RUL Prediction 
5.	Customized Dashboard and Reports based on the User Department/Role
6.	Managed Reporting Services to enable Business users to discover issues, opportunities, and challenges those needs to be addressed.
Solution Delivery Components: 
Following ground realities will be the detrimental factors for the Solution Delivery Design. The Solution will be designed in two parts;
1.	Analytics Solution Development (Conventional & Machine Learning)
2.	Managed Services for Reporting.
Please refer to the Annexures for a detailed approach for both.
Key Requirements for Solution Delivery:
1.	Business User Time is Precious: The time & availability constraints of the Business Users need to be considered throughout the Solution Development and Service Delivery stages.
2.	Consider complexities due to paradigm shift: The Solution should enable the Business Teams to face the challenges arising out of the paradigm shift.
3.	Speed of solution deployment: Especially in setting up the Exploratory Data Analytics & enabling Business Teams with Information related to usage patterns, vehicle behavior etc. are vital to the sustained success of the later stage development.
4.	Changing Assumptions and Requirements are imminent: Due to the newness of the vehicle technology and customer segments, there can be change in assumptions, (i.e. The change in Battery Charger clause for BEVs) The solution team needs to factor these into the Solution design and delivery.
5.	Value Delivery: The Solution should enable Business Teams to unlock hidden values in their operations, hence the Solution should always target a quantifiable Business value (Metrics).
Digitsthra will deploy its D LEAD (Lean Elastic Agile Delivery) to ensure robustness, agility and flexibility in the Solution Delivery. The deep Subject Matter Expertise of Digitsthra along with the D LEAD Delivery Architecture will ensure that we comply with all the above-mentioned requirements with minimum friction.
 
We are planning the following mode of engagements so that we are setting up the engagement for ensured success despite Business uncertainties.
1.	The paradigm shifts and the requirements dictated by the shift requires a close and flexible engagement with the Business teams for a sustained success and value realization. Hence the Service will be delivered based on monthly fixed fee with a dedicated number of consultants & with the flexibility to add more members when needed.
2.	These contracts will have mandatory reviews after a fixed period (say, 6 – 9 months) for converting them to fixed fees or Business outcome-based models.

2. Solution Objectives
In the spirit of “Building the right thing” rather than “Building things right”, the whole approach will treat the initiative as Solutions. 
This should help us discover more challenges & opportunities as we progress. The idea is to split the program into multiple solutions delivering value from different opportunities.
Given the paradigm shift, our approach is also to develop our current development methods of D LEAD and offer the development solution also to M&M.
Deploy & Improve D LEAD Delivery Architecture
•	Digitsthra delivery architecture follows an iterative, frequent improvement cycles to deliver the solution as a product and not as a project.
•	Build the right things than building them right.
•	Agile, Iterative methods to evaluate alternatives and deliver the right solutions.
•	Keep the design and architecture modular, flexible, and scalable to ensure future-proofing.
•	Work to convert D LEAD to M LEAD, a Lean Elastic Agile Delivery Method for building, managing, and continuously improving Analytics Solutions for M&M.
 
Solution Phases
The Solution will focus on long term Business advantages while anchoring on delivering the most urgent and important Solutions. The current approach is based on the current visibility, we will continuously improve, refine, and update the approach as we discover more opportunities.

Annexure 5 – Possibilities for Product Enhancement
Example: Approach for Using Driver Behaviour Patterns in Brake Booster Reaction Disc Specification (Or Brake Feel Improvement)
The function of the Brake Booster Reaction Disc 
(Since this is a sub-component and not everyone out of the Braking System or Vehicle Dynamics Teams may not understand, we take the freedom to explain the Component & its significance. The EVs may have a different config for Brake Feel, yet the same approach can be applied)
The primary function of the reaction disc is to modulate the force applied to the master cylinder based on the driver's input at the brake pedal.
It is typically made of a flexible, resilient material like rubber and is positioned between the Booster Diaphragm and the Master Cylinder Push Rod
When the driver presses the brake pedal, the brake booster amplifies this force using vacuum pressure. The reaction disc ensures that the amplified force is proportionally transferred to the master cylinder.
Impact on Brake Feel
The reaction disc plays a significant role in determining the "brake feel" for the driver. Brake feel refers to the feedback the driver senses through the brake pedal, including how responsive and firm the brakes feel. The reaction disc affects the brake feel in the following ways:
•	Responsiveness: A well-designed reaction disc ensures that the brakes are responsive to the driver's input, providing immediate feedback and control.
•	Pedal Firmness: The reaction disc's material and design determine the brake pedal's firmness. A stiffer reaction disc produces a firmer pedal feel, while a softer disc provides a more cushioned feel.
•	Modulation: The reaction disc allows for smooth modulation of braking force, enabling the driver to apply brakes progressively without abrupt changes in braking force.
Approach - Using Driver Behaviour Patterns in Brake Booster Reaction Disc Design
1. Data Collection	Collect data on driver behavior patterns using telematics and connected car systems. Categorize into behavior types.	Collect metrics like braking force, frequency, and duration. Categorize into Adventurous, Aggressive, Cautious & Conservative, and Normal.
2. Analysis of Driver Behavior Patterns	Analyze the distribution of driver behavior patterns.	20% Adventurous, 10% Aggressive, 30% Cautious & Conservative, 40% Normal.
3. Reaction Disc Specification Requirements	Define reaction disc specs based on behavior patterns.	Detailed below.
4. Design Integration	Develop modular brake booster design, adaptive systems, and brake control units (BCUs) with adaptive learning capabilities.	Modular brake booster platform, adaptive brake control systems, and BCUs that learn and adapt to braking patterns.
5. Simulation and Testing	Simulate scenarios and conduct real-world testing.	Use simulation tools and real-world tests to validate reaction disc specs.
Table: Reaction Disc Specification Requirements
Adventurous (20%)	High responsiveness, firm pedal feel.	Stiffer reaction disc for quick response and firm pedal feel.	Provides immediate feedback and control.	BCU with adaptive learning to optimize braking based on aggressive driving behaviors.	
Aggressive (10%)	Durability and performance.	Reinforced reaction disc to withstand high braking forces.	Ensures durability and consistent performance under aggressive braking.	BCU with adaptive learning to adjust braking parameters for enhanced durability and performance.	
Cautious & Conservative (30%)	Smooth modulation and comfort.	Softer reaction disc for smoother modulation and cushioned pedal feel.	Provides a more cushioned and progressive braking feel.	BCU with adaptive learning to maximize comfort and smooth braking under conservative driving conditions.	
Normal (40%)	Balanced performance.	Standard reaction disc providing a balance between firmness and modulation.	Offers a balanced feel for everyday driving.	BCU with adaptive learning to maintain a balance of performance and comfort for everyday driving.	
Conclusion
By integrating specific considerations such as reaction disc specifications and BCUs with adaptive learning capabilities into the brake booster design process based on driver behaviour patterns, manufacturers can create braking systems that cater to the diverse needs of different drivers. This approach enhances overall vehicle safety, braking performance, and driver satisfaction
